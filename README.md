## 📝 Description

This project was developed as the final assignment to complete the `BootCamp DevJr by Abútua` module 6. The application is a web page that allows the user to enter a Brazilian ZIP code (CEP) and, through a request to an external API, automatically fills in the address fields (street, neighborhood, city, and state).

The main goal was to apply the knowledge acquired throughout the course in a practical way, integrating front-end technologies to create a functional and user-friendly solution.
